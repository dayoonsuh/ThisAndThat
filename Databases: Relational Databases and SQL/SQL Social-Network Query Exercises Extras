Q1
For every situation where student A likes student B, but student B likes a different student C, return the names and grades of A, B, and C.

SELECT H1.name,H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade, H3.name, H3.grade
FROM Highschooler H1,Highschooler H2, Highschooler H3, Likes L1, Likes L2
WHERE H1.ID = L1.ID1 AND H2.ID = L1.ID2 AND H2.ID = L2.ID1 AND H3.ID = L2.ID2 AND H1.ID <>H3.ID;

Q2
Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from themselves. Return the students' names and grades.

SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler
WHERE name NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT H1.name
  FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2,Friend F
  WHERE F.ID1 = H1.ID AND F.ID2 = H2.ID AND H1.grade = H2.grade
);

Q3
What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.)

SELECT AVG(count_)
FROM (
	SELECT COUNT(ID2) AS count_
	FROM Friend
	GROUP BY ID1
);

Q4
Find the number of students who are either friends with Cassandra or are friends of friends of Cassandra. Do not count Cassandra, even though technically she is a friend of a friend.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Friend F1, Friend F2, Highschooler H
WHERE (F1.ID1 = H.ID AND name = "Cassandra") AND F1.ID2 = F2.ID1 ;

Q5
Find the name and grade of the student(s) with the greatest number of friends.

SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler H JOIN Friend F ON F.ID1 = H.ID
GROUP BY ID1
HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT MAX(friends)
					FROM (
            SELECT name, grade, COUNT(ID2) AS friends
            FROM Friend F JOIN Highschooler H on F.ID1 = H.ID
            GROUP BY ID1
            )
				  )
;
