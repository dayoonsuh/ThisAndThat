Food is one of the most important things for your successful trip. Especially when there are tons of restaurants and when you have no idea where to go, you might want to search something like "Best restaurant in __Location__".
However, there are also tons of food recommendations in the internet. It is really hard to pick a restaurant because there are so many recommendations with variety. Although you chose a nice-looking restaurant, there comes another question:

### What should I have?

[__Our 30 Favorite Things to Eat Right Now__](https://www.chicagomag.com/chicago-magazine/january-2023/our-30-favorite-things-to-eat-right-now/) in Chicago Magazine gives the perfect solutions for this question. They recommend a particular menu as well as the restaurant. They also give us the location of the restaurant and the price of the recommended menu.
However, I found one improvement point on this page. It would be better if we have a visual map of all the restaurants so that we can get some sense of how to plan our itenerary. Also, the article is pretty long so we have to keep scroll up and down to compare menu, price, address, and the name of the restaurant to compare the options.
Therefore, I created a dataframe and csv file by web scraping and extracting essential information from the website, and created a map that marks the location of the restaurants.
These file and map help travellers plan their itenerary by providing recommended item as well as price in a glimpse, and giving visual sense of locations of the restaurants.

The map looks like this:
